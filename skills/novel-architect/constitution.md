# Creative Guidelines

## Core Creative Principles

### I. Story First
**Content is King, Plot-Driven**
- Every chapter must advance the story.
- Avoid meaningless everyday descriptions.
- Conflict and tension are the lifeblood of the story.
- Keep the reader engaged and wanting to read more.

### II. Multi-Dimensional Characters
**The depth of character development determines the quality of the work.**
- Every character has their own motivations and goals.
- Character actions must be consistent with their personality.
- Show, don't tell: reveal characters through actions and dialogue, not direct description.
- Supporting characters should also be well-developed, not merely plot devices.

### III. Consistent Worldview
**The rationality and completeness of the setting.**
- Establish clear rules for how the world operates.
- Once established, the setting must remain consistent.
- Avoid arbitrarily changing the setting for plot convenience.
- The worldview serves the story, not the other way around.

### IV. Concise Language
**The power of words lies in precision, not embellishment.**
- Convey the most information with the fewest words.
- Avoid overuse of adjectives and adverbs.
- Dialogue should be appropriate to the character's identity and personality.
- Descriptions should be vivid, allowing the reader to immerse themselves in the scene.

### V. Authentic Emotion
**Genuine emotions are what move people.**
- Emotional development must have logic and process.
- Avoid abrupt emotional shifts.
- Show emotions through details, not direct preaching.
- Eliciting empathy from the reader is the ultimate goal.

## Writing Standards

### Principles to Follow
1. **Engaging Opening** - The first three paragraphs of each chapter must have a hook.
2. **Complete Chapters** - Each chapter should be a relatively complete mini-story.
3. **Plot Point Resolution** -  Plot points introduced must have corresponding resolutions.
4. **Logical Consistency** - The plot development must follow cause and effect logic.
5. **Pacing Control** - Maintain a balanced pace, avoiding constant tension or excessive dragging.

### Problems to Avoid
1. **Padding** - Meaningless repetition and delays.
2. **Character Inconsistency** - Character actions contradict their established personality.
3. **Forced Twists** - Sudden reversals without proper foreshadowing.
4. **Excessive Preaching** - Directly imposing values ​​on the reader.
5. **Overused Tropes** - Overuse of Clichéd Tropes

### Writing Style Requirements
- **Narrative Language:** Concise and fluent, avoiding lengthy sentences.
- **Dialogue Style:** Natural and vivid, consistent with the characters' personalities.
- **Descriptive Techniques:** Emphasize key points, with appropriate detail.
- **Use of Rhetoric:** Appropriate and not overly elaborate.

### Paragraph Formatting Guidelines
**Scene Transitions and Paragraph Separation**
- **Avoid:** Using numbers such as "one," "two," "three," etc., to mark paragraphs.
- This method is too rigid, like marking chapters in an essay.
- It disrupts the immersive reading experience of the novel.
- **Recommended Method:** Use blank lines for paragraph separation.
- Use two blank lines (one empty line) when transitioning between scenes.
- Natural and fluid, consistent with modern reading habits.
- Does not interrupt the reader's immersive experience.
- **Example:**
```
James packed his things and turned to leave the room.


In the kitchen, Sarah was preparing dinner.
