# Fantasy Novel Worldbuilding Guidelines

## Quick Reference

| Element | Guiding Principle | Key Points |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Magic System** | Must have clear rules | Limitations are more important than power |
| **World Setting** | Internally consistent | Every rule has a reason |
| **Races/Creatures** | Unique and logical | Avoid simply reskinning humans |
| **Historical Depth** | At least three generations of history | The past influences the present |
| **Political Structure** | Clear distribution of power | Conflicts have roots |

## Core Principles

### Sanderson's Laws of Magic

**First Law:** The reader's enjoyment of magic is directly proportional to their understanding of it.
- If magic is to solve problems, the reader must understand its rules.
- Soft magic systems (mysterious) are for atmosphere and wonder.
- Hard magic systems (clearly defined rules) are for problem-solving.

**Second Law:** Limitations are more interesting than power.
- Powerful magic requires powerful costs.
- Limitations create conflict and strategy.
- A perfect system cannot create drama.

**Third Law:** Before adding something new, expand on what you already have.
- Deepening existing elements is better than adding new ones.
- Interconnected systems are stronger than isolated ones.
- Complexity should grow organically.

## Magic System Design

### Hard Magic System (Clearly Defined Rules)

**Essential Elements:**
1. **Energy Source**
- Where does the magic come from? 
- Is it finite or infinite? 
- Can it be depleted?

2. **Rules of Use**
- Who can use it? How is it acquired? 
- What conditions are required? 
- What are the limitations?

3. **Costs/Consequences**
- What is the cost of using magic? 
- What happens with overuse? 
- Are there long-term effects?

4. **Possibilities and Impossibilities**
- What can the magic do? 
- Clearly define what it cannot do.
- Where are the boundaries? **Example Framework:**

```
Magic System: Elemental Manipulation
Source: Everyone is born with an affinity for one element.
Rules: Can only manipulate one's own element; the element must be present in the surroundings.
Limitations: Mental fatigue; overuse leads to elemental backlash.
Cost: Using magic consumes life force; requires rest to recover.
Taboos: Cannot create elements, only manipulate them; cannot manipulate elements within living beings.
```

### Soft Magic System (Sense of Mystery)

**Characteristics:**
- Rules are not fully known to the reader.
- Used more for atmosphere and wonder.
- Should not conveniently solve major conflicts.
- Maintains a sense of mystery and awe.

**Use Cases:**
- Ancient magic, partially lost.
- Divine power, beyond mortal understanding.
- Background wonders and world-building.
- Auxiliary plots that don't affect the main storyline's resolution.

## Worldbuilding Framework

### Geography and Environment

**Must Consider:**
1. **Terrain**
- How do mountains, rivers, and oceans affect civilization? 
- How does climate shape culture? 
- How does resource distribution affect the economy?

2. **Ecosystem**
- What is the food chain like? 
- How do magical creatures adapt to the environment? 
- How do humans/other intelligent races survive?

3. **Impact of Magic on Geography**
- How does magic alter nature? 
- Are there landmarks created by magic? 
- What traces have magical disasters left behind?

### Society and Culture

**Hierarchical Structure:**

**Political Level:**
- Forms of government (monarchy, democracy, theocracy, etc.)
- How is power transferred?
- How does magic influence politics?
- Conflicts between different factions

**Economic Level:**
- What is traded? Why?
- Monetary system
- How does magic affect the economy?
- Resource scarcity

**Social Level:**
- Class structure
- Race relations
- Status of magic users
- Education and knowledge dissemination

**Cultural Level:**
- Religion and beliefs
- Art and entertainment
- Festivals and traditions
- Values ​​and taboos

### Historical Depth

**At least three generations of history:**

**Contemporary** (when the story takes place):
- What is the current situation? - Main Conflicts and Problems
- Main Factions and Characters

**Parent Generation** (30-50 years ago):
- What events shaped the present day?
- What do the older generation remember?
- Lingering issues

**Grandparent Generation** (60-100 years ago):
- Legends and stories
- Lost knowledge
- Historical trauma

**Ancient Times** (Even further back):
- Myths and legends
- Rise and fall of civilizations
- Laying the groundwork for the present day

## Race and Creature Design

### Intelligent Races

**Avoid single characteristics**:
❌ All elves are elegant and noble
❌ All dwarves are greedy and ill-tempered
❌ All orcs are savage and warlike

**Create depth**:
✅ Internal diversity (different cultures, values)
✅ Individual differences (varying personalities)
✅ Historical complexity (good and bad history)

**Racial characteristics should have a reason**:
- How do physiological characteristics aid survival?
- Where do cultural characteristics come from?
- History of relationships with other races

### Magical Creatures

**Design Principles**:
1. **Ecological Niche**
- What is its role in the ecosystem? 
- What does it eat? What eats it? 
- How does it reproduce?

2. **Source of Magic**
- Why does it have magic? 
- How does magic help it survive? 
- What are the costs or limitations?

3. **Relationship with Humans**
- Dangerous or useful? 
- Can it be tamed? 
- How do humans interact with it? ## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Over-Explanation

**Problem:** Spending chapters explaining world-building, halting story progression

**Solution:**
- Show, don't tell, the setting through action
- Only explain what the characters need to know
- Let the reader piece things together themselves
- Information should serve the plot or characters

### ❌ Inconsistent Rules

**Problem:** Magic/world rules change for plot convenience

**Solution:**
- Establish all major rules beforehand
- Keep track of established rules
- Exceptions need early foreshadowing
- Let characters creatively solve problems within the limitations

### ❌ Default Medieval European Setting

**Problem:** All fantasy is a rehash of medieval Europe

**Solution:**
- Explore other cultures and time periods
- Mix multiple cultural elements
- Create unique social structures
- Consider how magic changes societal development

### ❌ Chosen One Trope

**Problem:** Protagonist is special because of prophecy/bloodline, not actions

**Solution:**
- Make the protagonist special through choices
- Even with a prophecy, make them work to fulfill it
- Subvert or deconstruct the trope
- Focus on character growth, not inherent talent

## Fantasy Subgenres

### High Fantasy (Epic Fantasy)
- Completely fictional world
- Good vs. Evil conflict
- Epic scale and stakes
- Magic is an integral part of the world

### Low Fantasy
- Real world + magical elements
- Smaller, personal stakes
- Magic is rare and mysterious
- More grounded tone

### Urban Fantasy
- Modern city setting
- Hidden magical world

- Collision of two worlds

### Dark Fantasy
- Morally ambiguous
- Horror and violence elements
- Anti-hero protagonists
- Harsher consequences

## Worldbuilding Checklist

## Information Revelation Strategy

### The Iceberg Principle

**Created vs. Shown**:
- Create 100%, but only show 10-20%
- Readers don't need to know everything
- Depth creates confidence and consistency
- The author knows more than they show

### Timing of Revelation

**Chapter One**:
- Basic world view (not exhaustive explanation)
- One compelling magic/fantasy element
- The protagonist's place in the world

**First 25%**:
- Core magic system rules
- Major races/cultures
- Central conflict and its world roots

**Mid-Story**:
- Deepen established elements
- Complicate world politics
- Reveal historical influences

**Later Stages**:
- Connect all world threads
- Reveal deeper history
- Show how world elements resolve the conflict

## Reader Expectations

**What Fantasy Readers Want**:
- An immersive, believable world
- A consistent and interesting magic system
- Complex cultures and politics
- A fresh perspective on classic tropes
- A world that feels bigger than the story

**What Frustrates Fantasy Readers**:
- Inconsistent world rules Convenient plot-driven magic
- Shallow, derivative imitation of medieval Europe
- Lack of depth in the world
- Information dumping instead of organic revelation

**Remember**: Great world-building is the foundation of the story, not the goal. The world should serve the characters and plot, and the characters' actions should be shaped and constrained by the world's rules. Balancing depth with narrative flow is key.
